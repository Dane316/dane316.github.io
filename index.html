			<h1>Welcome to Jamaica Trivia Game</h1>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				“Jamaica Trivia” game site is about my home country Jamaica.
				A colorful map of Jamaica is used with the parishes properly demarcated. Trivia questions
				are based on a culture, attaction, personality each parish is best known for.
				The map has small pictures that are intended to help you come up with the correct answer.
				The goal will be to click on the parish that correctly matches the trivia question and aim to get 100%.
				Please visit the information page where you will also find small pieces of information that will broaden your
				Jamaican knowledge. But if you think you already know Jamaica, go right into the game. Play as often as you like and have FUN !! <br><br>
